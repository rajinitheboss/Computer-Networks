This time I had to implement 3 threads for each of the node which is difficult 

for this assignment I have almost 4hrs for debugging as even a small mistake can change the results of the 
outcome. 

in total I have implemented 3*n + 1 threads excluding the main thread. 

This is a bit difficult for me to do but I have done it anyways
