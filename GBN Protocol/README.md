* How to run the code
    Normal running server and receiver where each one is run in different terminals
    here given inline commands after typing normal python commmand 
    ex - 'python sender.py {args}'
    as python does not have executables

* Since we are running the things in same machine with different ports the corruption of packet
    doesnot occur but it is likely to happen practically
    and if drop probability is low we will not get any retransmissions and we get the ratio 1
