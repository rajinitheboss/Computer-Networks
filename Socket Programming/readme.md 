For every question I have created a folder where there will be two program codes. one for server
and another for client. 
I have written all the codes in python. 
Every time one code should be run in one terminal and another should be run in another terminal

For question 1:
    after running server program in one terminal and client program in another terminal the client
    program prompts to enter a message until you type "exit". For every string that is given as input
    client will print the same again as output.

For question 2:
    I have written a UDP based math server. 
    since I have written in python, I have prompted the user to enter the port number for both 
    server and client 

For question3 :
    I have written a TCP based server when server and client run in two different terminals the client 
    prompts for the name of the file and size of file the server will return the end bytes of the file 
    and the client will take the bytes and save them into another file.
